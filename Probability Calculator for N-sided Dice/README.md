# Dice Simulation and Probability Distribution

This Python project simulates rolling M number of N-sided dice K times and calculates the probability distribution of the possible sums.

## Features
- Simulate a single roll of M N-sided dice
- Simulate K such rolls and collect outcomes
- Calculate and display probability distribution
- User input via CLI
- Includes unittests for both normal and edge cases

## Requirements
- Python 3.x

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Run the simulation:
   ```bash
   python main.py
3. To run test
python -m unittest test_dice.py
