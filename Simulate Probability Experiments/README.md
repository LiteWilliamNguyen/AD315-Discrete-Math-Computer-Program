# Probability Experiment Simulator

## Overview
This is a Python-based probability experiment simulator that allows users to run various probability experiments, including coin tosses, die rolls, drawing cards, and compound coin tosses.

## Features
- Simulate coin tosses, die rolls, drawing cards, and compound coin tosses
- User-input for the number of trials
- Display results in a clear and concise manner
- Menu-driven interface for easy navigation

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd probability-experiment-simulator
   ```
3. Run the simulator:
   ```bash
   python components/probability_experiment.py
   ```
4. Follow the menu prompts to select an experiment and input the number of trials.

## Experiments
### Coin Toss
- Simulates a coin toss experiment
- Input the number of tosses
- Displays the results, including the number of heads and tails

### Die Roll
- Simulates a die roll experiment
- Input the number of rolls
- Displays the results, including the frequency of each outcome

### Drawing Card
- Simulates drawing a card from a shuffled deck
- Input the number of cards to draw
- Displays the results, including the number of red and black cards

### Compound Coin Toss
- Simulates a compound coin toss experiment
- Input the number of compound tosses
- Displays the results, including the number of both heads and at least one head

## Requirements
